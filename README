Socket Avalon
=============

This is an app to do the setup phase of [The Resistance:
Avalon](http://www.indieboardsandcards.com/RESAvalon.php). It uses
[socket.io](http://socket.io) with a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
database, which is managed by [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/). The frontend
is Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

It's a bit hacky...
